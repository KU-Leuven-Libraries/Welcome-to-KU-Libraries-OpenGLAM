# KU Leuven Libraries on GitHub

The GitHub repository of the KU Leuven Libraries provides a space for generating and sharing discussion, raising awareness and inspiring the exploration of documentary heritage in KU Leuven Libraries’ collections. It makes available resources in the form of open datasets, code and cookbooks for working with digitised documentary heritage through computational methods, integrating the Libraries’ digitised heritage collections for data driven scholarship.

  

# Documentary Heritage

In the context of documentary heritage a document is considered as a transmissive, reproducible and semantically rich form of mobile record that captures diverse aspects of social organisation, systems of thought and cultural agencies. Documents can reify the collective memory of smaller or larger communities, shaping certain material, mental or experiential shared realities.

  

# Digitised Collections

KU Leuven Libraries is a staunch advocate for digitisation as a means of preserving our cultural past and safeguarding it to the future as a human right, contending also with its own experience through dark heritage events (the library and its collections have a traumatic history being [burned down twice](https://bib.kuleuven.be/english/about/hIistory-tourism) before regenerating into its contemporary being).

Its [digitised documentary heritage collections](https://limo.libis.be/primo-explore/collectionDiscovery?vid=KULeuven&collectionId=81386064490001488&lang=en_US) encompass a living database of more than 85.000 works within a 1200 years timespan, ranging from the Late Antiquity through the European, Mediterranean and Middle East geographies to the 20th century world history of living memory.

  

# Communities of Practice

We aim to enfold co-creative practices and ethics for working with humanities data and cultural heritage assets that are well described and easy to access for communities of researchers, students, GLAMs and all curious minds, as well as creative bots and other computational agencies. The GitHub repository is set up to increase transparency of digital humanities’ knowledge networks and workflows, affording human editable and machine actionable cultural data. The repository is envisioned to enable a recursive data sharing model by utilizing an -all contributors- spec table (emoji key) and by publishing related research output in the git-wiki roadmap of its repository. In order to ensure reuse by means of openness and eligibility, repositories are assigned with standardized interoperable rights statement, licenses and code of conduct.
