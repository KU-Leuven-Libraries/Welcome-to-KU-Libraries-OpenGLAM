# KU Leuven Libraries on GitHub
The GitHub repository of the KU Leuven Libraries provides a space for generating and sharing discussion, raising awareness and inspiring the exploration of documentary heritage in KU Leuven Libraries’ collections. It makes available resources in the form of open datasets, code and cookbooks for working with documentary heritage through computational methods, integrating the Libraries’ digitised heritage collections for data-driven scholarship. 

# Documentary Heritage
In the context of documentary heritage a document is considered as a transmissive, reproducible, semantically rich form of mobile record that captures diverse aspects of social organisation, systems of thought and cultural agencies.

# Digitised Collections
KU Leuven Libraries is an advocate for digitisation as a means of preserving the cultural past and safeguarding it for the future. The library contends also with its own experience through dark heritage events (the building and its collections have a traumatic history being [burned down twice](https://bib.kuleuven.be/english/about/hIistory-tourism) before regenerating into its current form).
Its [digitised documentary heritage collections](https://limo.libis.be/primo-explore/collectionDiscovery?vid=KULeuven&collectionId=81386064490001488&lang=en_US) encompass a living database of more than 85.000 works within a 1200 years timespan, ranging from the Late Antiquity through the European, Mediterranean and Middle East geographies to the 20th century world history of living memory.

# Communities of Practice
We aim to promote open-access publishing and implement good practices for working with humanities data and cultural heritage assets that are well described and easy to access for researchers, students, GLAMs and all curious minds, creative bots and other computational agencies. 
We aspire to integrate more cooperative, inclusive and engaging models of working together, being an active member of the international openGLAM scene. The GitHub repository is set up to increase transparency of DH-GLAM networks and workflows. In order to ensure reuse by means of openness and eligibility, repositories are assigned with standardized interoperable rights statement, licenses and code of conduct.
